The world builder is a power tool.  There are a myriad of actions you can perform via its UI; many of which are not immediately obvious.

Hopefully this helps clear them up!


# Managing Nodes

Since you'll be spending most of your time in the world builder playing with various nodes, let's make sure you know all the dirty secrets of nodes:

## Creating Nodes

Nearly every button in the world builder's menu creates a node.  Note that nodes are grouped by category (biome, noise, instanced features, etc), and that each node is colored by its type.

## Renaming Nodes

You can rename any node by right clicking on its title.  Giving nodes custom names is extremely helpful, especially when you have complicated graphs of them!  Feel free to rename with wild abandon.

## Positioning Nodes

The world builder lets you move nodes wherever you like: Simply drag them via their title.

However, manually organizing nodes can quickly become a hassle.  The world builder also provides a very helpful auto layout feature.  When you have a node selected (by clicking its title), pressing "auto layout" in the menu will cause all child nodes connected to it to fit to columns.

## Collapsing Nodes

You can also collapse nodes by clicking the green minus button in its title.  This will hide all but the node's title.  It will also hide its child nodes.  Very handy for focusing on some portion of your world.

## Deleting Nodes

Clicking the red x button in the title of a node will delete it (after prompting you).

ctrl-clicking the delete button will delete a node _and its child nodes_.  Very handy, but also very easy to do on accident!

## Deleting Connections

Ctrl-click on a connection's input or output to delete it.  Holding ctrl will display an x on all inputs/outputs.

## Creating Connections

Click on an input/output, and then click on the corresponding input/output that you wish to connect to.

## Copy/Paste

To copy a node, _and all its children_, press the magenta C button in its title.  You can then paste that node (and children) by pressing "paste" in the menu.
